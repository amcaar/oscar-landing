# What is Node-RED and FlowFuse?

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click. FlowFuse, on the other hand, appears to be an extension or a set of tools built around Node-RED, designed to enhance its capabilities, particularly in integrating more complex workflows or enhancing connectivity with various services and protocols.

# What is OSCAR?

# How works a workflow in Node-RED?

A workflow in Node-RED is a set of nodes connected together to create a flow of operations. Each node performs an operation, and the data moves between nodes via wires in the visual interface. Users can drag and drop different types of nodes from the palette into a workspace and configure them to perform tasks like receiving data, processing it, and sending it elsewhere. Flows can be triggered by web requests, handle files, interact with APIs, and perform a multitude of other functions, typically in an IoT or device integration context.

# Deploying a workflow

Deploying a workflow in Node-RED involves moving a developed flow from the construction environment (usually a local machine or a development server) to a production environment where it will run. This is typically done with a few clicks in the Node-RED interface. The deployment makes the flow active, allowing it to interact with real-world data and users. Adjustments to deployed flows can often be made in real-time, and version control can be implemented to manage changes systematically.

# How works the Node-RED Library?

The Node-RED Library allows users to share and reuse flows and function nodes. It is a repository where developers can publish their flows, making them available to the wider community. Users can browse this library to find pre-built solutions or components that can be imported directly into their projects. This feature significantly speeds up development time and fosters a collaborative environment by leveraging community contributions.
